# Linear-Regression

Project from `School 42`

Introduction to Machine Learning with Linear Regression and gradient descent algorithm

### Subject

The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning. For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a *gradient descent algorithm*.

### To use

- Run `bundle install`.

- `ruby prediction.rb` and see mileages prediction at 0.
- Run `machine_learning.rb` with the `.data.csv` file.
- Let's start again the `prediction.rb` and see the estimation.
